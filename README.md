## Readme for Using mitmproxy to Monitor Mobile App Network Traffic

This guide explains how to use mitmproxy to inspect network traffic generated by your mobile app, helping you debug and analyze communication between the app and external servers.

**Requirements:**

* mitmproxy installed on your computer
* Mobile device with the app installed
* Android: Rooted device or emulator with a custom ROM
* iOS: iPhone with jailbreak or iOS 15+ (may require additional tools)

**Steps:**

1. **Install and configure mitmproxy:**
    * Download and install mitmproxy for your operating system.
    * Configure mitmproxy to listen on port 8080.

2. **Install CA certificate on your mobile device:**
    * Download the mitmproxy CA certificate.
    * Install the CA certificate on your mobile device as a trusted certificate.
    * Android: Use an app like "Install CA Certificate" or manually install through Settings.
    * iOS: Use a jailbreak tweak like "TSLCertTweak" or manually install with tools like "Cydia Impactor".

3. **Configure proxy settings on your mobile device:**
    * Android: Navigate to WiFi settings, select your network, and configure a manual proxy with your computer's IP address and port 8080.
    * iOS: Navigate to WiFi settings, select your network, configure a manual proxy with your computer's IP address and port 8080, and choose "Automatic" for authentication.

4. **Start mitmproxy:**
    * Open a terminal and run the command `mitmproxy -p 8080`.

5. **Run your mobile app:**
    * Start the app on your mobile device and observe the network activity in the mitmproxy interface.

**Troubleshooting:**

**Issue:** Mobile app doesn't connect through the proxy.

**Solution:**

* Check if the CA certificate is properly installed and trusted on your mobile device.
* Verify the proxy settings are correct on your mobile device.
* Ensure mitmproxy is running on your computer and listening on the correct port.
* Restart your mobile device and try again.

**Issue:** SSL/TLS connections are not intercepted.

**Solution:**

* Ensure the mitmproxy CA certificate is installed and trusted as a root certificate on your mobile device.
* Use a tool like "frida" on Android to bypass SSL/TLS certificate pinning in the app.
* Consider using a proxy tool specifically designed for mobile app debugging, like Charles Proxy.

**Additional notes:**

* Rooting your Android device or jailbreaking your iOS device may be required for full control over network traffic.
* Some mobile apps may use HTTPS pinning or other techniques to prevent their traffic from being intercepted.
* Be aware of the ethical implications of monitoring traffic from other applications.
